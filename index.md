Hello and welcome to this blog.

## Main Goals

# I will set out several goals for the year, then monthly goals then weekly goals.

I hope to spend this year creating a greyhound betting system and hopefully this blog will keep me on track to achieve at least something this year where previously I have simply just saved greyhound races over the last several years and taken the fastai lessons but ever produced any ideas or predictive code.

I will also use this to increase my Python skills as a daily goal 

I will follow a tipster or two for football betting and record my profits and loss

I will be using matched betting to provide some funds to test the systems 

I will look into Draw Index to trade football games on betfair, maybe creating a AI to give my own prediction

I would also like to record wild swimming adventures

I would like to look into cross market arbs in football to achieve positive outcome events.

Do I create several blogs for each goal or just create one ass its main aim is to keep track of what I am doing.
