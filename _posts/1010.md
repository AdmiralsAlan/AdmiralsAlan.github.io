# Aim to create a Greyhound system thoughts
   1.  System to find the forcast probability for each race and then obtain the best 5 and place test bets on over a period of time to test the viability.
   2.  System to find 3 greyhounds which could win and then bet all 3 in each race to find a short odds chance which will hopefully be odds over evens and a probability 
   3.  of greater than 50 percent
